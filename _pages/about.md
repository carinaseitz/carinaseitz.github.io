Hi! I’m Carina, an Assistant Researcher and Teaching Assistant at the Department of Geology and Petroleum, INIBIOMA, Centro Regional Universitario Bariloche (CRUB) (Universidad Nacional del Comahue-CONICET), San Carlos de Bariloche (Argentina). I am also part of the GECARA group at the INIBIOMA Institute, which studies aquatic ecosystems and particularly water quality.

My work focuses on understanding how aquatic ecosystems respond to natural and anthropogenic factors, including, but not limited to, the ecosystems of Northern Patagonia. I use Neo- and Paleo-limnology to better understand these ecosystems' changes and inform for management and conservation.

My work and research
======
I am a geologist, geomorphologist, and aquatic (paleo)ecologist with a broad background in ecology — but I have just enough expertise in programming and Environmental-social science to make trouble. I consider myself a methodological and disciplinary pluralist, as I draw from and contribute to many different academic disciplines. 

My background and history
=====
I received my B.A. in geology at the Universidad Nacional de Rio Cuarto (Argentina). After my B.A. I worked for 4.5 years at a consulting company until I started my Ph.D in geology and became a teaching assistant at the Universidad Nacional del Sur (Argentina). After receiving my Ph.D, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Regina (SK, Canada) and then at the University of Nevada, Reno (NV, USA). After this, I became an investigator in the Department of Geology and Petroleum at the Centro Regional Universitario Bariloche (CRUB) from the Universidad Nacional del Comahue-CONICET. **I have led several research and education efforts, including the institute’s Data Science Studies efforts and the Best Practices in Data Science series.**

My intellectual communities (IN PROGRESS)
======

I’m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like computer science, information science, social psychology, and organization/management science with fields like philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and history of science and technology. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and new media / internet studies. Methodologically, while I am trained as a qualitative ethnographer, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.
