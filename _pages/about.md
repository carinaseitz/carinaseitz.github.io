Hi! I’m Carina, an Assistant Researcher and Teaching Assistant at the Department of Geology and Petroleum, INIBIOMA, Centro Regional Universitario Bariloche (CRUB) (Universidad Nacional del Comahue-CONICET), San Carlos de Bariloche (Argentina). I am also part of the GECARA group at the INIBIOMA Institute, which studies aquatic ecosystems and particularly water quality.

My work focuses on understanding how aquatic ecosystems respond to natural and anthropogenic factors, including, but not limited to, the ecosystems of Northern Patagonia. I use Neo- and Paleo-limnology to better understand these ecosystems' changes and inform for management and conservation.

My work and research
======
I am a geologist, geomorphologist, and aquatic (paleo)ecologist with a broad background in ecology — but I have just enough expertise in programming and Environmental-social science to make trouble. I consider myself a methodological and disciplinary pluralist, as I draw from and contribute to many different academic disciplines. 

My background and history
=====
I received my B.A. in geology at the Universidad Nacional de Rio Cuarto (Argentina). After my B.A. I worked for 4.5 years at a consulting company until I started my Ph.D in geology and became a teaching assistant at the Universidad Nacional del Sur (Argentina). After receiving my Ph.D, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Regina (SK, Canada) and then at the University of Nevada, Reno (NV, USA). After this experiences, I became an investigator in the Department of Geology and Petroleum at the Centro Regional Universitario Bariloche (CRUB) from the Universidad Nacional del Comahue-CONICET.
