Abstract: More than 13,000 shallow lakes reside today in the Pampean Region of Argentina. Besides their importance for the agricultural and economic sustainability of this region, there is limited knowledge about their origin and evolution and, in particular, about their fate as they face climate change. In this work, we reconstruct the origin and history four shallow Pampeman lakes, namely Puan, Los Chilenos, Sauce Grande, and La Salada based on process geomorphology being them examples of a large percentage of the shallow lakes present in the region. Results indicate that landscape evolution and basin formation in the Pampean Region have been strongly controlled by neotectonism in the Late Pleistocene, and Holocene climate variability. The basins where the lakes are located were formed by deflation in the case of Puan and La Salada, by fluvial, tectonic and eolian processes in Los Chilenos, and by fluvial, eolian, and coastal processes in Sauce Grande. After 1000 yr before present, these basins were filled with water resulting from climate amelioration. This study indicates that the hydrology of the Pampean Region is highly sensitive to changes in precipitation and wind erosion, and that future scenarios of increased erosion by wind and water can modify the hydrologic connectivity and, therefore, the resilience of the lakes located in this region.
